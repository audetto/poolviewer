This is a Qt toolkit based project.
To build you will need Qt devel pacakges and libusb1.0 devel packages.

For windows the makefile assumes libusb lives is c:\libusb, change the poolview.pro file as appropriate.

To build:
qmake
make

To build a debug version:
make clean
qmake
make debug

For the software to access the poolmate pod device you'll probably need something like the following in udev/rules.d-

51-poolmate.rules:

SUBSYSTEMS=="usb" ATTRS{idVendor}=="0451" ATTRS{idProduct}=="5051" MODE:="0666"
